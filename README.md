# SkillSwap Platform - Python Django Version

A peer-to-peer skill exchange platform where users offer skills they have and request skills they want to learn — completely free, no money involved.

---

## Features

- **Authentication** — Sign up / sign in with JWT tokens
- **Discover** — Browse and filter users by skill category or search
- **Skill Swap Requests** — Send, accept, reject, and complete swap requests
- **Profile Management** — Manage your bio, skills offered, skills wanted, and availability
- **Notifications** — Real-time notification system for swap activity
- **Admin Panel** — Secure admin dashboard for managing users and platform stats

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | HTML + Tailwind CSS + React (via CDN) |
| Backend | Python Django + Django REST Framework |
| Database | SQLite (for simplicity) |
| Authentication | JWT (PyJWT) + bcrypt |
| Development | Simple JavaScript (no TypeScript) |

---

## Admin Accounts

Admin users are created by `seed_database.py`.

Use environment variables before seeding:

- `SEED_ADMIN_1_EMAIL`
- `SEED_ADMIN_2_EMAIL`
- `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

If not set, safe demo defaults are used (`admin1@example.com`, `admin2@example.com`).

## Local Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your PC:

- **Python** 3.8 or higher — https://www.python.org
- **pip** (usually comes with Python)

---

### Step 1 — Navigate to the backend directory

```bash
cd backend
```

---

### Step 2 — Create a virtual environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 3 — Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 4 — Set up the database

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Step 5 — Seed the database

```bash
python seed_database.py
```

This creates:
- 2 admin accounts (Shrushti and Roshni)
- 5 sample users with skills
- Sample swap requests and notifications

---

### Step 6 — Start the Django server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will run at `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Step 7 — Open the frontend

Open another terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Then open the `index.html` file in your browser:

```bash
# If you have a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 3000

# Or simply open the file in your browser
open index.html
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` or directly open the `index.html` file.

## Key Differences from Original

This simplified version uses:

1. **Python Django** instead of Node.js/Express
2. **SQLite** instead of PostgreSQL (easier setup)
3. **Plain JavaScript** instead of TypeScript
4. **React via CDN** instead of complex build tools
5. **Simplified API client** without code generation
6. **Same UI/UX** and all original features

---

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use**: Change the port in the `runserver` command: `python manage.py runserver 8080`

**Database connection failed**: Make sure you ran the migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

**No data showing**: Run the seeder script: `python seed_database.py`

**Login fails**: Use the admin accounts or sample users created by the seeder script

**CORS errors**: Make sure the Django server is running and the frontend is accessing the correct API URL

---

## Development Notes

- The backend uses Django with Django REST Framework
- Authentication is handled via JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- The frontend uses React loaded from CDN for simplicity
- No build process required - just open the HTML file
- Database is SQLite for easy development and deployment
